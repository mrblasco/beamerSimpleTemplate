>> “... AT&T has begun to open up its innovation process beyond its labs and to encourage employee participation. [...] Employees vote for ideas and [...] Leaders then decide whether or not to grant seed funding to create prototypes. [...] AT&T has allocated $44 million to fund ideas ranging from customer-service enhancements to new technologies.” Source: WSJ, 2014

# Methodology

__The context:__ an eight-week internal contest for ideas within a medical institution in the US (over 1200 employees)

__Treatment:__ solicitation emails encouraging employees to make submissions by the opportunity of winning a monetary reward, with a control group in which the monetary reward was not mentioned

__Outcomes:__ (a) the decision to participate with a submission (b) the quality of the submissions




# Results

>- Positive effect on participation associated with monetary rewards (on average a 3 percentage point increase in participation).

>- Women reacted more strongly than men, controlling for differences in the professional status of the worker

>- We don’t detect any effect on the distribution of the quality of submissions

>> [...] All [employees] are eligible to submit ideas online. We encourage you to submit as many ideas as you have: no ideas are too big or too small!

>> Submissions will be reviewed and judged in two rounds, first [...] via crowd-voting, and then by an expert panel. Winning ideas will be eligible for project implementation funding [...]

# Conclusions

- Evidence is consistent with theory: prizes raise participation (helps private provision of public goods)
- Evidence of different preferences between the genders [as in @croson2009gender] may have strong practical implications
- Quality unchanged by monetary incentives (what is the underlying cost function for quality?)
