>> “... AT&T has begun to open up its innovation process beyond its labs and to encourage employee participation. [...] Employees vote for ideas and [...] Leaders then decide whether or not to grant seed funding to create prototypes. [...] AT&T has allocated $44 million to fund ideas ranging from customer-service enhancements to new technologies.” Source: WSJ, 2014

# Previous literature

>- __Prizes__ compensate workers for effort [@lazear1981rank; @gibbs2014field]

>- Shared ideas, solving organizational problems are __“public goods”__ and prizes help workers mitigate a free riding problem [@morgan2000financing; @morgan2000funding; @lange2007using]; 

>- __Non-materialistic incentives__ altruism, peer recognition, job satisfaction, etc. [@deci1985intrinsic; @moldovanu2007contests; @blanes2011tournaments; @kosfeld2011getting]

# Methodology

__The context:__ an eight-week internal contest for ideas within a medical institution in the US (over 1200 employees)

__Treatment:__ solicitation emails encouraging employees to make submissions by the opportunity of winning a monetary reward, with a control group in which the monetary reward was not mentioned

__Outcomes:__ (a) the decision to participate with a submission (b) the quality of the submissions




# Results

>- Positive effect on participation associated with monetary rewards (on average a 3 percentage point increase in participation).

>- Women reacted more strongly than men, controlling for differences in the professional status of the worker

>- We don’t detect any effect on the distribution of the quality of submissions

# The solicitation email
>> Submit your ideas to [__(1)win an Apple iPad mini| (2)improve patient care at the Heart Center| (3)Improve the workplace at the Heart Center| (4)win project funding up to \$20,000 to turn your ideas into actions__]

>> [...] All [employees] are eligible to submit ideas online. We encourage you to submit as many ideas as you have: no ideas are too big or too small!

>> Submissions will be reviewed and judged in two rounds, first [...] via crowd-voting, and then by an expert panel. Winning ideas will be eligible for project implementation funding [...]



# Conclusions

- Evidence is consistent with theory: prizes raise participation (helps private provision of public goods)
- Evidence of different preferences between the genders [as in @croson2009gender] may have strong practical implications
- Quality unchanged by monetary incentives (what is the underlying cost function for quality?)

# Thanks!
